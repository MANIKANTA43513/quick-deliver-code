# Google Chrome Scroll Animation Recreation

## 🎯 Assignment Overview

This project recreates the sophisticated scroll-driven animations from the **Google Chrome homepage** for the Huemn Interactive Pvt Ltd frontend developer assignment. The focus is on the dynamic section where features are revealed and transformed as the user scrolls down the page.

## 🎬 Animation Concept

The core technique uses `position: sticky` with a tall container (4x viewport height) to create the illusion of staying in place while providing a large scroll area for smooth animations. As users scroll, they witness 4 distinct scenes that transition seamlessly:

### **Scene 1: "The browser built to be yours"**
- Features browser mockup with theme customization
- Color picker interface with smooth reveal animations

### **Scene 2: "Extensions"** 
- Showcases popular Chrome extensions
- Google Translate, Arts & Culture, Password Manager, AdBlock icons
- Staggered animation entrance with rotation effects

### **Scene 3: "Take control of your tabs"**
- Displays tab grouping functionality
- Project Alpha, Portfolio, and Research tab groups
- Slide-in animations with color-coded organization

### **Scene 4: "Helpful features built-in"**
- Highlights built-in Chrome features
- Password Manager, Safety Check, and Smart Downloads
- Scale and bounce entrance effects

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Build Tool**: Vite for lightning-fast development and optimized builds  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system and SCSS capabilities
- **Animation Engine**: GSAP (GreenSock) with ScrollTrigger plugin for professional-grade animations
- **UI Foundation**: Custom components with glassmorphism design patterns

## 🎨 Core Animation Features

### **GSAP Timeline System**
- **Master Timeline**: Single timeline controlling all 4 animation scenes
- **ScrollTrigger Integration**: Animations perfectly synchronized with scroll position
- **Scrub Effect**: Smooth 1:1 relationship between scroll and animation progress
- **Easing Functions**: Professional easing (power2, back.out) for natural motion

### **Sticky Positioning Magic**
- **Container Height**: 400vh (4x viewport) provides ample scroll area
- **Sticky Content**: Visual elements stay centered while container scrolls
- **Scene Transitions**: Smooth opacity and transform transitions between scenes

### **Advanced Animation Techniques**
- **Staggered Animations**: Elements animate in sequence with calculated delays
- **Transform Combinations**: Scale, rotation, and translation for complex motion
- **State Management**: Proper cleanup and ScrollTrigger disposal

## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### **Animation Architecture**
```javascript
// Master timeline with ScrollTrigger
const tl = gsap.timeline({
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: containerRef.current,
    start: "top top",
    end: "bottom bottom", 
    scrub: 1, // Smooth 1:1 scroll sync
  }
});

// Scene transitions with precise timing
tl.fromTo(element, { opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1, duration: 0.5 })
  .to(previousScene, { opacity: 0, y: -30 }, "+=0.5")
  .fromTo(nextScene, { y: 50 }, { y: 0, opacity: 1 }, "-=0.2");
```

### **Sticky Container Technique**
```css
/* Container: 400vh height for scroll area */
.animation-container { height: 400vh; }

/* Content: Sticky positioning stays centered */
.sticky-content { 
  position: sticky; 
  top: 0; 
  height: 100vh; 
}
```

## 🚀 Live Deployment
